       <h4 >IMP. Here comes another misery.</h4>.
        
             <h4>[IMP _opens the door to admit the_ POOR MAN, _who is very shabbily
             dressed. He hesitates, looks around the room as if he were in the
             wrong place, and then addresses_ IMP _in a loud whisper_.</h4>
        
        <h4>POOR MAN. </h4><p>[_Indicating the_ JUDGE _with a motion of his head_.] </p>Is that
        him?</p>
        
        <h4>IMP. </h4><p>[_Whispering loudly his reply._] </p>Yes, that is his honor.</p>
        
        <h4>POOR MAN.</h4> <p>[_Still whispering and showing signs of nervousness._]</p> Do I
        dare speak to him?</p>
        
       <h4> IMP.</h4><p> [_Enjoying the situation and still whispering._] </p>Yes, but be
        careful what you say.</p>
        
       <h4> POOR MAN. </h4><p>[_Takes off his hat, approaches slowly to the railing, and
        speaks humbly._] </p>Your honor. I--<p>[_Swallows hard, clears throat._] </p>Your
        honor, I've a little favor--to ask of you.</p>
        
        <h4>JUDGE.</h4><p> [_Looking coldly at the_ POOR MAN.] </p>Well?</p>
