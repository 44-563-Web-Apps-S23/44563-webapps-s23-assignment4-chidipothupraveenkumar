       <p>IMP. Here comes another misery.
        
             [IMP _opens the door to admit the_ POOR MAN, _who is very shabbily
             dressed. He hesitates, looks around the room as if he were in the
             wrong place, and then addresses_ IMP _in a loud whisper_.<br>
        
        POOR MAN. [_Indicating the_ JUDGE _with a motion of his head_.] Is that
        him?<br>
        
        IMP. [_Whispering loudly his reply._] Yes, that is his honor.<br>
        
        POOR MAN. [_Still whispering and showing signs of nervousness._] Do I
        dare speak to him?<br>
        
        IMP. [_Enjoying the situation and still whispering._] Yes, but be
        careful what you say.<br>
        
        POOR MAN. [_Takes off his hat, approaches slowly to the railing, and
        speaks humbly._] Your honor. I--[_Swallows hard, clears throat._] Your
        honor, I've a little favor--to ask of you.<br>
        
        JUDGE. [_Looking coldly at the_ POOR MAN.] Well?<br>
